# StopSmoking
By tracking the amount of cigarettes consumed and the money spent, this Android-App can help smokers to find some extra
motivation for stop smoking. By showing the total amount of money spent (or smoked) on cigarettes, the user can feel
scared on all the wasted money, while by showing the evolution on the amount of cigarettes smoked per day, the user can
easily detect when its addiction gets worse, or when it is doing a good progress.

## Main Screen
For each cigarette smoked, the user can add it for today's date with the + Button

## Edit past days
To pick up a date in the past and modify the amount of cigarettes smoked.

## See statistics
Here the user can see a graphic on the evolution of smoked cigarettes per day, the total amount of cigarettes and money
smoked, and the average of cigarettes smoked, counting only the days where the user has smoked.

## Settings
The user can configure how much cigarettes each packet contains, so as its price. This data will be used as base to
calculate the amount of spent money.
The user can also choose the used currency, or 'units' if the own currency is not listed.
